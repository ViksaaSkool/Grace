So what is this about? It's simple - mobile application that let's you bless your meals before you eat. You can upload image from your gallery,
or take photo of a meal and let his Grace bless it. His Grace using [clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) check if the meal you've provided is one of meal or not and if it is 
he does his magic.
